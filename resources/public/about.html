      <h1>What if we could curate the internet?</h1>
      <p>Linkletter is a link curation platform. It helps you search, collect and organise curated links. Whatever you bookmark from the internet is added to a publicly searchable repository. Through Linkletter we want to eliminate self promotion, bandwagon effect and solely focus on the content.</p>
      <p>The quality of a link is judged by how many people have found it useful and not by who has shared it (celebrities in Twitter), how many likes (Facebook) or up-votes (Quora, Reddit) it has got. Unlike most communities or social networks, It is not a follower based platform. It is kind of like Google search for bookmarked links where the webcrawlers are actual people.</p>
